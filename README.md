<h1>StreamCorn [unmaintained]</h1>
</div>
A simple app for scraping and playing movie and TV shows from streaming websites.

**Note:** I've made this app while learning Adroid development, it probably won't work because websites are updated very often and I'm not working on it anymore.

## Features
 - Scrape streaming website links
 - Movie and TV shows info from TMDB rest API
 - Play media with VLC
